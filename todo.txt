* Run xunit tests
	* Parameterise which test suites to run
	* Run tests from the directories they're compiled within - change the globs for harvesting to something like src/**/bin/configuration/**/*...?
* Generate coverage files
* Generate coverage reports
* Distinguish between C# projects:
	* OutputType Exe, Library
	* Web - project file imports ...Web.Application.targets
* Compile views/markup of web-application
* Only harvest those parts of a web-application that should make it into deployment
	* Exclude C# files
	* Exclude ...
	* Perhaps leverage web-deployment-project...?  Another dependency, though...
* Change xunit so that it runs the suites in-place, rather than relying on their being harvested
	* Fixes problem of difference-in-path between VS host and out_dir hosted...?
* Publish as a gem
* Change to 7zip instead of depend on cygwin...?
* Provide an InstallPad for the 3rdparty bits
