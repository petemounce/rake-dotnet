This folder contains files to assist with integrating more informative and attractive results into your CruiseControl.Net web reports.

When integrating NCover into your CruiseControl.Net build process, you can t ransform the raw coverage.xml
using NCover.Reporting to produce xml which you merge instead of the raw coverage files

  PROS: - range of report types available such as sequence point or function coverage.
        - detail level of reports can range from summary, module/class or method level.
        - additional information in reports such as overall statistics and code metrics.
        - apply exclusions from assembly to method level, and have these optionally reported.
        - optionally fail builds based on coverage thresholds not being met either at per module or overall threshold levels.
        - can merge multiple xml file outputs before processing into a single report
        - generate xml for merging into your build log, as well as optional html reports directly.
  CONS: - requires 5-10 minutes of initial configuration setup time (but thats a one off)

	
The files included in this folder are as follows:

  dashboard.config      - Example of modifications to use NCoverReporting stylesheets instead of the CC.Net supplied ones.
  NCoverReporting30.xsl - For rendering the full html reports by parsing xml generated by NCover.Reporting v3.0 merged into your build log.
                          You will display this report by replacing the "NCover Report" link on the LHS of your web dashboard
	

To make use of the NCover.Reporting.exe stylesheets do the following:

(1) Copy the NCoverReporting30.xsl stylesheet into the following folder:
    C:\Program Files\Cruise Control.Net\webDashboard\xsl

    Note that if you wanted to include NCoverReporting reports in your emails, you should also copy to:
    C:\Program Files\Cruise Control.Net\server\xsl

(2) Copy r.png, y.png, and g.png into the following folder: 
    C:\Program Files\Cruise Control.Net\images
  
(3) Edit this file:
    C:\Program Files\Cruise Control.Net\webDashboard\dashboard.config

    The example dashboard.config in this folder shows how to replace the NCover stylesheets with
    the NCover.Reporting alternatives.

(4) Add a NAnt or MSBuild task running NCover.Reporting.exe which will process the
    coverage.xml file(s) to produce an xml report output. You can either use an <exec> task or you
    can use our custom <NCoverReporting> (MSBuild) or <ncoverreporting> (NAnt) tasks located in the
    NCover.MSBuildTasks.dll or NCover.NAntTasks.dll respectively. Note these
    dlls also contain tasks for automating NCover.

(5) In your CruiseControl.Net project, merge the resulting CoverageReport.xml into the buildlog
    using a merge task in your <publishers> section of your CC.Net project xml file (ccnet.config).
